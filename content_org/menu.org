I am a teacher assistant at the University of Granada, specialised in Artificial
Intelligence. As many people, I have several roles:

- Since a researcher side, I have a index-h of 15, with more than 24 papers
  (more than 90% in Q1), with more than 3000 citations. In the main menu, you can
  see my publications (in many case with the PDF freely available, ask me if you
  need any other). Also, I am currently the Chair on the [[http://tflsgo.org/][IEEE CIS Task Force on
  Large-Scale Global Optimization]], because it is a type of optimization I am
  particularly interested (I was winner in two international competitions, at
  2010 and more recently at 2018).

- As a teacher, now I am teaching at the University of Granada, in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta][Ceuta]], but for
  more than 10 years I was teaching in the University of CÃ¡diz, where I left a
  part of my hearts (people were more my friends than my colleagues).

- As a computer science that love programming, I am interesting in programming
  in different languages (like C++, Java, ....), and I particularly love Python,
  and another interesting growing languages (like Rust or Julia). I define
  myself also as a Linux user, this is the only OS in my computers for more than
  15 years. Also, I am a truly believer in [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][Free Software]] (actually, I was the 
  secretary of Free Software Office at the University of Cadiz. 

- As a real-world person, I love reading books, watching films, and spend my
  free time with my girlfriend Amalia :heart:.
