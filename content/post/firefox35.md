I have recently changed to [Firefox 3.5](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), and it is awesome!!

The main improvements I have checked:

-   Better performance.

-   Reader mode, it is very useful to read without distractions, specially in
    mobile. Also, it is mouseless friendly, with the shortkey **Ctrl+Alt+r**.

-   Screenshots of a website, that you can share with anybody (not more excuses
    for my students for not showing me their web app in develop).

The bad thing is that many extensions are not valid anymore:

-   [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) has changed to be a java application, and the great [Zotelo (extension
    for Emacs)](https://github.com/vspinu/zotelo) is not working anymore :-(.

-   Also, several extensions to improve the mouseless navigation stop working.

Fortunately, _uBlock Origin_ is still working, and I have found [Tridactyl](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tridactyl-vim/), an
extension with several nice features:

-   **f** and **F** allows you to open links (in same tab or new) identifying them with
    letters (in a very sensible way, my favourive way until now).

-   **b** is bookmarks, it allows you to go to another open tab.

-   **s** is search mode using the history, with tab you can go your favourite website
    more easily.

-   And **ZZ** close all firefox tabs, very useful for a person with Vim-background
    like me :-).

To summarize, if you do not like use the mouse for almost everything, and you
want to browse more easily, try [Tridactyl](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tridactyl-vim/).
