I write because I am organizing the [Large-Scale Global Optimization Competition](https://www.tflsgo.org/special%5Fsessions/wcci2020.html)
at the [IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation WCCI'2020](https://wcci2020.org/), with interesting
news:

-   I am not more the Chair of the IEEE CIS Task Force on Large Scale Global
    Optimization, but I organize in collaboration with them.

-   The new site [tacolab.org](https://tacolab.org) to compare your own proposals with existings ones, it
    do the tables, figures and comparisons for you (including statistical
    testing). Also, it includes data of all previous winners!

-   The deadline is 30 January, there is still time.

So, there is not excuse for not participating, I wait you in Glasglow!
