I write because I am organizing the [Large-Scale Global Optimization Competition](http://www.tflsgo.org/special%5Fsessions/cec2019.html)
at the [IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC'2019](http://cec2019.org/), with interesting
news:

-   Source code for C++/Matlab/Java/Python.

-   The source code store during the run all required files with the results, you
    do not need to worry about that, we do it for you!

-   In python it is as simple as _pip install cec2013lsgo_ to be able to run the
    experiments, in C++, and the source code and documentation is [freely available](https://github.com/dmolina/cec2013lsgo/).

-   The new site [tacolab.org](https://tacolab.org) to compare your own proposals with existings ones, it
    do the tables, figures and comparisons for you (including statistical testing).

There is not excuse for not participating!
