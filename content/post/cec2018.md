Several weeks ago, I was at the the [IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation
(CEC'2018)](http://www.ecomp.poli.br/~wcci2018/), and also at the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
in Spain, [website](https://sci2s.ugr.es/caepia18/inicio.html).

In <https://speakerdeck.com/dmolina> there are the slides of my
presentations in the International Conference.

In particular, my works are the following:

-   A new algorithm, **SHADE-ILS** which won the Large Scale Global Optimization,
    [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/dmolina/shade-with-iterative-local-search-for-large-scale-global-optimization). You spanish readers, there is also a new [version in Spanish.](https://speakerdeck.com/dmolina/shade-con-una-busqueda-local-iterativa-para-optimizacion-continua-de-alta-dimensionalidad)

-   A new website for comparisons algorithms, <https://tacolab.org>, which is briefly
    described [here in English](https://speakerdeck.com/dmolina/taco-toolkit-for-automatic-comparison-optimizers-for-lsgo), and [also in Spanish](http://slides.tacolab.org/).

**PS**: I will talk about the Tacolab website in next entries, because it is the
results of many weeks of works.
