The last year I have been working in a promising programming language,
[Julia](<http://julialang.org/>).

Even I have done a presentation focused on people with Computer Science
background (so the talk compares Julia against Python),

[Talk in English](https://github.com/dmolina/julia%5Fpresentacion/raw/master/Julia%5FPresentation%5Fslides.pdf)

Also it was given in Spanish

The resources of that talk are available at [Github
Repository](<https://github.com/dmolina/julia%5Fpresentacion/>).
