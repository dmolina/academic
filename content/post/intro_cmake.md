In my last course, I decided to give a small introduction about CMake. The
reason is that, although we teach them Make, the majority of students do not use
them in their programs. In fact, many times they create a "makefile" program to
pretend they are using "make", but actually, it is a bash script.
My intention is to teach them [**Cmake**](http://cmake.org/) to encourage them to use an automatic tool
for compiling, expecting they use it more, by its simpler syntax.
