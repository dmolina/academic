I am a teacher assistant at the University of Granada, specialised in Artificial
Intelligence. As many people, I have several roles:

-   Since a researcher side, I have a index-h of 16, with more than 24 papers
    (more than 18 in Q1), with more than 3000 citations. In the main menu, you
    can see my publications (in many case with the PDF freely available, ask me
    if you need any other). Also, I was until this year the Chair on the [IEEE
    CIS Task Force on Large-Scale Global Optimization](http://tflsgo.org/),
    because it is a type of optimization I am particularly interested (I was
    winner in two international competitions, at 2010 and more recently at
    2018).

-   As a teacher, now I am teaching at the University of Granada, in [Ceuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta), but for
    more than 10 years I was teaching in the University of CÃ¡diz, where I left a
    part of my hearts (people were more my friends than my colleagues).

-   As a computer science that love programming, I am interesting in programming
    in different languages (like C++, Java, ....), and I particularly love Python,
    and another interesting growing languages (like Rust or Julia). I define
    myself also as a Linux user, this is the only OS in my computers for more than
    15 years. Also, I am a truly believer in [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (actually, I was the
    secretary of Free Software Office at the University of Cadiz.

-   As a real-world person, I love reading books, watching films, and spend my
    free time with my girlfriend Amalia :heart:.
