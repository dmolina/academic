I am a teacher assistant at the University of Granada, specialised in Artificial
Intelligence. As many people, I have several roles:

-   Since a researcher side, I have a index-h of 15, with more than 24 papers
    (more than 90% in Q1), with more than 3000 citations. In the main menu, you can
    see my publications (in many case with the PDF freely available, ask me if you
    need any other). Also, I am currently the Chair on the [IEEE CIS Task Force on
    Large-Scale Global Optimization](http://tflsgo.org/), because it is a type of optimization I am
    particularly interested (I was winner in two international competitions, at
    2010 and more recently at 2018).

-   As a teacher, now I am teaching at the University of Granada, in [Ceuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta), but for
    more than 10 years I was teaching in the University of Cádiz, where I left a
    part of my heart (these people were more my friends than my colleagues).

-   As a computer science that love programming, I am interesting in programming
    in different languages (like C++, Java, ....), and I particularly love Python,
    and another interesting growing languages (like Rust or Julia). I define
    myself also as a Linux user, this is the only OS in my computers for more than
    15 years. Also, I am a truly believer in [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (actually, I was the
    secretary of Free Software Office at the University of Cadiz.

-   As a real-world person, I love reading books, watching films, and spend my
    free time with my girlfriend Amalia :heart:.
